# Lazarus Game

This is a single player game about survivial! You have to try to get your lazarus character to the top of the structure, to press the stop button, without getting squished by a box. Boxes stack if they overlap each other, but they can also break if a heavier box lands over it. The box hiearchy goes as: Stone --> Metal --> Wood --> Cardboard. The controls are: left arrow key and right arrow key. Download the jar file to play it now!
